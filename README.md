# Dynamic PVEbanner

This is just a simple replacement for the Proxmox `/usr/bin/pvebanner` perl script to make the MOTD dynamic based on where the proxmox server is and what IP it has at the time.

I use this on my Intel NUC proxmox server as I travel with it and many times I don't know what IP it's picked up so having a quick glance at what the new IP is help a lot.
